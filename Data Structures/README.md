## Overview
The main objective of this assignment is to implement a patient queuing system for a clinic by using only linked list data structures. Operations on the linked list such as add, delete, search, sort are built from scratch. The intention of this assignment is to test the understanding and implementation of linked list data structures in C++ programming.

## Features
- Add or remove patient to the waiting list
- Call next patient in waiting list based on priority
- Filter patient based on current logged in doctor when entering treatment
- Login or logout for doctors and nurses
- Modify patient history in history list
- Search patient from waiting list and history list
- View patient history list *(can be sorted by time or sickness description)*
- View patient waiting list *(can be sorted by time or patient ID)*
